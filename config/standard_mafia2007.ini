#Copyright has a very long request when fetching the previous flag
#it appears that it returns the account name of every user it has created thus far
#making it slow down after long period of use
#Currently, with my relatively short timeout of 30 seconds, this service appears to be down
#when in fact it is just timing out while waiting for this long request to complete

#on the mafia image, in /home/amends/php-includes/filter.php
#modify function filter_ccnum -> change the two occurrences of
#40 to 51 (new flag length)
#Also, flag is now urlsafe base64 encoded, ('-' and '_' instead of '+' and '\')
#the regex should match this
#This change is done on images from the ictf site.
#Finally, in the amends.sql in the database dir, ccnum has a field length of 50
#this is to short (must be at least 51) the ictf site version has a length of 64
